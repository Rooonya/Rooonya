<p>Hey friends! I'm Ranya.</p>
<p>By day, I'm the story-crafter for Nablus University- NUVTE, covering everything from student life to high-stakes meetings with the university president.</p>
<p>Between juggling translations and shaping the university's public image, you'll find me watching silly cats videos, doing sports, or getting lost in the pages of a good book. Loud laugh included!</p>
<p> In the midst of it all, my motto is simple: "Trust your struggle".</p>
